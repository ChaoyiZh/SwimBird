## 🌟 Method
We introduce SwimBird, a hybrid autoregressive MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states
as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision–text reasoning. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks.

## 🛠 Preparation
```
git clone https://github.com/Accio-Lab/SwimBird.git
cd SwimBird

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install qwen-vl-utils
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## 🎯 Training
To train the model, follow these steps:
1. Replace Qwen3-VL's `chat_template.json` with ours.
2. Download the training datasets [SwimBird-SFT-92K]() and add the dataset absolute directory path as a prefix to all image paths in the JSON files:

```Shell
python data_process.py absolute_path_to_dataset
```

Example:
```Shell
python data_process.py /abs_path/SwimBird-ZebraCoT/
python data_process.py /abs_path/SwimBird-MathCanvas/
python data_process.py /abs_path/SwimBird-ThinkMorph/
python data_process.py /abs_path/SwimBird-OpenMMReasoner/
```


3. Run the training script with the following command:

```Shell
bash scripts/train.sh
```

## 📖 Evaluation
We adopt [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to conduct the evaluation. You can get started as follows:
### 1. Setup 

```Shell
cd VLMEvalKit
pip install -e.
```

### 2. Inference
Notably, we evaluate our model with the LLM-based API judge setting rather than exact matching for a more accurate and reliable assessment. We set gpt-4o-0806 as the default judge model, and you can replace it with your own.


```Shell
bash test.sh
```

The path to our model: `VLMEvalKit/vlmeval/vlm/swimbird`
